## Overview

Quikyu is an AI-powered smart ticketing platform designed to revolutionize train ticket booking in Indonesia. The platform addresses critical issues plaguing current train booking systems: server crashes during peak demand, bot traffic dominance, and poor user experience.

## The Problem

Traditional train ticketing systems in Indonesia face severe challenges:

- **Frequent server crashes** during peak booking periods
- **70% bot traffic dominance** preventing real customers from booking
- **15+ minute average wait times** with frequent timeouts
- **Poor user satisfaction (28%)** due to system failures
- **Unfair ticket distribution** with scalpers dominating availability

---

## Our Solution

Quikyu implements a multi-layer intelligent system that transforms the ticketing experience:

### 1. **AI Traffic Prediction**
- Historical data analysis to predict ticket surges
- Accounts for holidays, discounts, and special events
- Proactively prepares the system for high-demand periods

### 2. **Smart Waiting Room Activation**

- DNS-level redirect to high-load servers
- Keeps the main system stable and responsive

### 3. **Trust Score Assessment**

- Prevents bots from reaching the booking form

### 4. **Form Interaction Analysis**
- AI monitors user behavior during multi-page form completion
- Analyzes mouse movements, typing patterns, and interaction timing
- Real-time behavioral biometrics for bot detection

### 5. **Final Verification & Booking**
